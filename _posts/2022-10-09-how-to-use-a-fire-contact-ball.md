This blog post will show you how to use a fire contact ball.

Here are the wizard's experiences wrapped up in a digest.
This will tell you what works and what you should avoid.
What kind of fuel to use and what moves are good when doing fire
contact juggling. Let's get started. 

## Skill level

First things first: fire contact juggling is *not for beginners*.

You should have a little bit of control over the ball and be able to do some body
rolls without dropping it too often. You don't have to be a pro, but you should already
have progressed with body rolls. If you don't have these skills yet,
there are some great resources on youtube to teach you the ins and outs of
body rolls.

## Fuel

Use alcohol at 70%.

Isopropyl, aka isopropanol, aka IPA, works best. It's just rubbing alcohol.
That's what you use to disinfect your hands every day during covid.
This fuel burns a lot less hot then something like lamp oil.
You can get it on ebay or at any pharmacy which makes it also a great toy to
travel with since the next pharmacy is never far away. Alcohol also evaporates
quickly and thus it doesn't smell strong for too long.
70% means that 30% of the liquid is water and water doesn't burn or evaporate
so it will stay on the ball after you've used it until it dried up again.
So the first time in the evening it will work best because the ball was still dry. 
The second time it will burn a little less long since it's wet from the first time.
The third time it will be even wetter and so on... That's just something to keep in
mind. 

## How to soak it

A wizard usually soaks the whole ball in isopropanol, he get a burntime of
about four minutes out of it. The flow wizard's fire
contact balls have about 3.2m of 10mm thick kevlar rope around the ball which makes
it soak up the liquid really well.
At best put a metal plate underneath it while pouring
the IPA over it to put it back into the bottle if you spill any.

## What to wear

Do yourself a favour and wear a *long sleeve cotten shirt*.
You can also just wear a normal shirt, but if you *don't want to lose your
precious arm hair* you're better off wearing longsleeve. 
Since we're rolling a ball that's soaked with alcohol over our body, your
clothes will also absorb some of the alcohol which will consequently make your
clothes smell like strong alcohol. A wizard finds it best to wear a dedicated
long sleeve cotten shirt when fire contact juggling.

## More people doing fire contact juggling?

A wizard would be very excited to see more people doing fire contact juggling 
Fire contact juggling is something that looks very cool, magical and mesmerizing.
When a wizard performs with the fire contact ball for a crowd he always gets a
lot of attention and people are always wondering how he does it.
Fire contact juggling is not very much around for several reasons:

1. Contact juggling is just hard and not many people are good at it
2. Fire contact juggling means that you are in direct contact with the fire and
   that seems very stressful/dangerous to many people even those who would be
   good enough to do it.
3. Many people don't know how to do it, which is why I'm making this video

## Where to get a fire ball

There are several options. The first one is *do one yourself*. All you need is a
needle, a kevlar string, 3.2m 10mm kevlar and an aluminium ball. Stitch the
whole thing together and voila. I might make a video on how to do one yourself
soon. Please write in the comments below if you would like to see such a video.

The second option is to *buy one from me* (Germany).
I have an <a
href='https://www.etsy.com/listing/535567449/fire-contact-juggling-ball'>etsy
shop</a> but since etsy is milking
it's vendors like crazy. I'd appreciate it if you just sent me a message and order one
from me like that. I charge 120â‚¬ for a ball since it's otherwise not worthwhile to
me make them.

Your third options is to buy one from Brandon from <a
href='https://flowmancer.com.au/index.php/product/fire-contact-ball/'>**the
Flow Mancer**</a> from Australia. I met him at spinfest 2017 in Australia when 
he told me to try making a fire ball with a knot. I didn't think this would be
possible but eventually he figured it out. I've seen his ball before at 
conventions and his fire contact ball works really well.

In case you know of any other vendor who sells fire contact balls please write in the comments.

## Moves that are good for contact juggling

Rule #1: Always keep the ball moving. When it starts to burn I
usually do isolation movements like the enigma and hold it
in one spot so that the ball starts fire properly.
Once the whole ball is on fire I start to do the full
body and arm rolls.
The full body rolls are the best since the ball will not be in touch
with the body for too long and your skin won't heat up and burn. Furthermore
you can also just have it in your flat palm. You usually have a couple of
seconds until it gets too hot. When it gets too hot you can transition into the
other hand or the the tips of your fingers.

A wizard has done this video will showcase some of the moves I am doing. 
These moves are my moves, and not the only moves you can do. I am sure there are
many more moves that are good for fire contact juggling.
