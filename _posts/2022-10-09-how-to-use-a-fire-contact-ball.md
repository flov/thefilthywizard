## Hi everyone!

Today I'm going to show you how to use a fire contact ball.
Many people have requested a video on how to use a fire contact
ball. 

First of all I want to make it clear that fire contact juggling is not for
beginners. You should have some control over the ball and do some body
rolls without it dropping every time. If you don't have these skills yet,
there are some great resources on youtube to teach you the ins and outs of
body rolls.

### Fuel

Now for the fuel that you should use it's best to use alcohol at 70%.
Isopropyl aka isopropanol or IPA works best. It's just rubbing alcohol
and that's what you use to disinfect your hands every day during covid season.
This fuel burns a lot less hot then something like lamp oil.
You can get it on ebay or at any pharmacy which makes it also a great toy to
travel with since the next pharmacy is never far away. Alcohol also evaporates
quickly and thus it doesn't smell strong for too long.
70% means that 30% of the liquid is water and water doesn't burn or evaporate
so it will stay on the ball after you've used it until it dried up again.
So the first time in the evening it will work best because the ball was still dry. 
The second time it will burn a little less long since it's wet from the first time.
The third time it will be even wetter and thus the burn time will be less than before and so on...
If the sun allows it I would put the ball into the sun the next day and then by
the time of the next evening it should be dry.

## How to soak it

I usually soak the whole ball in isopropanol and by soaking it completely, if
it's windstill, I get a burntime of about four minutes (!) out of it. My fire
contact balls have about 3.2m 10mm thick kevlar rope around the ball which makes
it soak up the liquid really well. At best put a metal plate underneath it while pouring
the IPA over it to put it back into the bottle if you spill any.

## What to wear

Do yourself a favour and wear a *long sleeve cotten shirt*.
You can also just wear a normal shirt, but if you **don't want to lose your
precious arm hair** you're better off wearing longsleeve. 
Since we're rolling a ball that's soaked with alcohol over our body, your
clothes will also absorb some of the alcohol which will consequently make your
clothes smell like strong alcohol. So I find it best to have a dedicated long sleeve
cotten shirt, to use when fire contact juggling, which you can change after.

## More people doing fire contact juggling?

Honestly I would be very excited to see more people doing fire contact juggling 
Fire contact juggling is something that looks very cool, magical and mesmerizing.
Whenever I do it in front of a big crowd I get at least
a couple of people who come up to me afterwards saying "Wow, that's so cool I've never seen
this before!". It's not very much around and when I'm at a convention I'm usually the only
person doing it for several reasons:

1. Contact juggling is just hard and not many people are good at it
2. Fire contact juggling means that you are in direct contact with the fire and
   that seems very stressful/dangerous to many people even those who would be
   good enough to do it.
3. Many people don't know how to start it, which is why I'm making this video

## Moves that are good for contact juggling

Rule #1: Always keep the ball moving. When I start to burn the contact ball I
usually do isolation movements like the enigma and hold it in one spot just to
get it burning properly. Once the whole ball is on fire I start to do the full
body rolls The full body roll is the best, since the ball will not be in touch
with the body for too long and your skin won't heat up and burn. Furthermore
you can also just have it in your flat palm. You usually have a couple of
seconds until it gets too hot and then you can transition into the other hand
or the the tips of your fingers. This video will showcase some of the moves I
am doing.
