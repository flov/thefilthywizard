In this blog post, a
wizard will show you how to use a fire contact ball.
Since a wizard has been selling more and more of his fire contact balls,
more and more people have requested instructions on how to properly use it.

So here a wizard shares his experiences with you. What works and what you
should avoid. What kind of fuel to use and what moves are good when doing fire
contact juggling. Let's get started. 

### 1. Skill level

First of all the wizard wishes to make it clear that fire contact juggling is
*not for beginners*.

You should have a little bit of control over the ball and be able to do some body
rolls without dropping it too often. You don't have to be a pro, but you should already
have progressed with body rolls. If you don't have these skills yet,
there are some great resources on youtube to teach you the ins and outs of
body rolls.

### 2. Fuel

Use alcohol at 70%.

Isopropyl, aka isopropanol, aka IPA, works best. It's just rubbing alcohol.
That's what you use to disinfect your hands every day during covid season.
This fuel burns a lot less hot then something like lamp oil.
You can get it on ebay or at any pharmacy which makes it also a great toy to
travel with since the next pharmacy is never far away. Alcohol also evaporates
quickly and thus it doesn't smell strong for too long.
70% means that 30% of the liquid is water and water doesn't burn or evaporate
so it will stay on the ball after you've used it until it dried up again.
So the first time in the evening it will work best because the ball was still dry. 
The second time it will burn a little less long since it's wet from the first time.
The third time it will be even wetter and thus the burn time will be less than
before and so on...
If the sun allows it I would put the ball into the sun the next day and then by
the time of the next evening it should be dry.

## 3. How to soak it

I usually soak the whole ball in isopropanol and by soaking it completely, if
it's windstill, I get a burntime of about four minutes out of it. My fire
contact balls have about 3.2m 10mm thick kevlar rope around the ball which makes
it soak up the liquid really well. At best put a metal plate underneath it while pouring
the IPA over it to put it back into the bottle if you spill any.

## 4. What to wear

Do yourself a favour and wear a *long sleeve cotten shirt*.
You can also just wear a normal shirt, but if you **don't want to lose your
precious arm hair** you're better off wearing longsleeve. 
Since we're rolling a ball that's soaked with alcohol over our body, your
clothes will also absorb some of the alcohol which will consequently make your
clothes smell like strong alcohol. A wizard finds it best to wear a dedicated
long sleeve cotten shirt when fire contact juggling.

## More people doing fire contact juggling?

A wizard would be very excited to see more people doing fire contact juggling 
Fire contact juggling is something that looks very cool, magical and mesmerizing.
When a wizard performs with the fire contact ball for a crowd he always gets a
lot of attention and people are always wondering how he does it.
Fire contact juggling is not very much around and when the flow wizard is at a
convention he is usually the only person doing it for several reasons:

1. Contact juggling is just hard and not many people are good at it
2. Fire contact juggling means that you are in direct contact with the fire and
   that seems very stressful/dangerous to many people even those who would be
   good enough to do it.
3. Many people don't know how to start it, which is why I'm making this video

## Moves that are good for contact juggling

Rule #1: Always keep the ball moving. When a wizard starts to burn it he
usually does isolation movements in the beginning like the enigma and holds it
in one spot so that the ball starts fire properly.
Once the whole ball is on fire a wizard starts to do the full
body rolls and arm rolls.
The full body rolls are the best since the ball will not be in touch
with the body for too long and your skin won't heat up and burn. Furthermore
you can also just have it in your flat palm. You usually have a couple of
seconds until it gets too hot. When it gets too hot you can transition into the
other hand or the the tips of your fingers.

A wizard has done this video will showcase some of the moves I am doing. 
These moves are my moves, and not the only moves you can do. I am sure there are
many more moves that are good for fire contact juggling.
