This is the Flow Wizards Blog. The flow wizard has been practicing circus
arts since the <a href='http://www.eclipse2012.com/'>Eclipse festival</a>
2012 where he was deeply moved by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPRnwEpLwc'>Okotanpe</a>.
Determined to learn the art of contact wizardry he dedicated much of his time
to the 🔮, hoping that one day he'd also be able to express himself like
one of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4SvKCsxq0o'>these</a> <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXzMRKG8fJU'>grand</a> <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSgM7-vv3tQ'>masters</a>.
Ever since then his love for the juggle magic grew and grew.
After having learned and tought more of this wichcraft at the circus school in
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82111hRjKq0'>Pai</a> and the circus school <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1N1Y-El7I'>Phare Ponleu Selpak</a>, he started giving
workshops at the <a href='/img/rainbow_teach.jpg'>Rainbow
Serpent Festival</a> 2014 and
<a href='{{ site.url }}/img/freqs_trippers.jpg'>Freqs Of
  Nature</a> 2015. He also enjoyed doing <a
  href='{{site.url}}/img/max_and_me_counting_the_bounty.jpg'>street performances in Melboure
with friends</a>.

Nowadays he <a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/1606555842972691/'>supports
 venues</a> and events with performances, gives
<a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/1027430407366238/'>contact
  juggling workshops</a> to wizard apprentices and
<a href='/img/freqs_trippers.jpg'>he enchants trippers on the dancefloor</a>.

The flow wizard is not only flowy but also pretty lazy to keep this
website up to date. For the latest pics, vids and his upcoming gigs, please
visit his <a href='http://facebook.com/theflowiz'>facebook
  page</a>.

If you know about an intersting event where The Flow
Wizard should not be missing, please drop him a line.
