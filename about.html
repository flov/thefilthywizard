<img src="/img/wizard.jpg" alt="contact wizard" />

This is the Flow Wizards Blog. The flow wizard has been practicing circus
arts since the <a href='http://www.eclipse2012.com/'>Eclipse festival</a>
2012 where he was deeply moved by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPRnwEpLwc'>Okotanpe</a>.
Determined to learn the art of contact wizardry he dedicated much of his time
to the ðŸ”®, hoping that one day he'd also be able to express himself like
one of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4SvKCsxq0o'>these</a> <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXzMRKG8fJU'>grand</a> <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSgM7-vv3tQ'>masters</a>.
Ever since then his love for the juggle magic grew and grew.
After having learned and tought more of this wichcraft at the circus school in
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82111hRjKq0'>Pai</a> and the circus school <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1N1Y-El7I'>Phare Ponleu Selpak</a>, he started giving
workshops at the <a href='/img/rainbow_teach.jpg'>Rainbow
Serpent Festival</a> 2014 and Freqs Of Nature</a> 2015. He also enjoyed doing street performances in Melboure
with friends.

Nowadays he <a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/1606555842972691/'>supports
 venues</a> and events with performances, gives
<a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/1027430407366238/'>contact
  juggling workshops</a> to wizard apprentices and
he enchants trippers on festivals.

The flow wizard is not only flowy but also pretty lazy to keep this
website up to date. For the latest pics, vids and his upcoming gigs, please

Wizard should not be missing, please drop him a line.
