## The flow wizard

<img src="/img/wizard.jpg" alt="contact wizard" />

This is the Flow Wizards Blog.

The flow wizard has been practicing all kinds of
flow arts since the <a href='http://www.eclipse2012.com/'>Eclipse festival</a>
in 2012. At this magical festival he was deeply moved by <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPRnwEpLwc'>Okotanpe</a> who was a
japanese contact juggler performing together with a fire juggling group called
the tribal ninjas. The whole stage was illuminated by fire when a single person
came on the stage with nothing more than a contact Ball and mesmerized the audience.
Determined to learn this kind of art of magic, the flow wizard dedicated much
of his time to the ðŸ”®, hoping that one day he'd also be able to express himself like
this.
Ever since then his love for the contact juggle magic grew and grew.
After having learned the basics of contact juggling, he started to explore the
world of street performances. He was fascinated by the idea of performing in
public and entertaining people with his art. The street performances were a lot
of fun to him, especially when he has done them with fellow juggling friends.
After a while he started to get more and more into the flow arts community and
he started to perform at festivals and
street events and was amazed by the positive feedback he got from the audience.
He was also amazed by the fact that he was able to make some money out of this passion 
which funded parts of his travels. 

After about a year after he started contact juggling he travelled to the circus school in
Battambang, Cambodia which was called <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1N1Y-El7I'>Phare Ponleu Selpak</a>.
There he started giving workshops to children aged 7 to 14.
When returning to Australia he continued his teaching at the <a href='/img/rainbow_teach.jpg'>Rainbow Serpent Festival</a> 2014 and Freqs Of Nature 2015. 

Nowadays (2022) he teaches at conventions like phoenix fire conventions, sells
his fire balls to fellow contact juggling wizards and enchants trippers on the dancefloor.
